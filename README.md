# No_Show_Appointments
No_Show_Apppointment dataset provides information from 65,535 appointments made in Brazil with 14 variables. Mainly focuses on the question of whether patients who make appointments actually show up for the appointments they make. We have in the dataset the patient's ID which is the identification of each patient,Neighbourhood which gives the information of whether the hospital is located at,We have ScheduleDay which tells dey when the patient set up the appointment,Scholarship which indicates whether the patient is a beneficiary of the brasilian welfare program(Bolsa Familia). AppointmentID is the identification of each patient for appointment. SMS_received show whether the patient received any message to make the appointment. Gender is another variable in our dataset and age of the patient.The diseases the patients have are also variables such as Diabetes,Hipertension,Alcoholism, and handcap.Which have values 1 for true and 0 for false. Appointment Day is when the patient had scheduled the appointment to take place. No_ show is also a variable which shows whether the patient showed up for the appointment made or not. With No implying that the patient showed up for the appointment and Yes implying that the patient did not show up for the appointment.

Summary Findings
Of the 65,535 appointments made only 51,614 patients showed up for their appointment and 13,921 didn't show up.The number of patients showing up for the scheduled appointments was influenced by the disease a patient was suffering from with hypertension having the most patients showing up for the scheduled appointments and handicapped patients having the least number of patients who show up for the scheduled apppointments.

The number of females and males who show up for the apppointments is more than those who don't show up for each diagnosis. More women than men show up for the appointments in all the diagnosis(i.e Diabetes,Hypertension and Handicap) except for alcoholism where more men have made appointments and more show up for appointments made than women. 
Women are more concerned about their health status than men.

78.53% of the women that made appointments  showed up for ther the appointments with 79.16% of the men who made appointments showing up for the appointments. This shows that men are more concerned with their health than women.

Of the 6,580 patients who have scholarship 74.3% of them showed up for the appointment made and 25.7% of them didn't show up for the appointments made.There is no correlation between a patients under scholarship and  them showing up for appointments made.

Of the 51,614 patients that had showed up for appointment only 27.1% of them had received the SMS and 72.9% of them had not received the SMS.Receiving an SMS does not contribute greately to the number of patients showing up for the appointments done.

Even after receiving the SMS 28.2% of the patients did not show up for their appointments.


One limitation of my exploration is that the scatter plots are not clear enough since the data values are only 2 for most of the variables.
